# Elliptic-Curve-Digital-Signature-Algorithm
ECDSA was simulated using the developed high speed and less complex ECC algorithm which resulted in the best signature generation and verification timings of any digital signature algorithm. Also, ECDSA proved to be far more secure than any other digital signature algorithm. 
A hybrid digital certificate using ECC was also proposed and implemented. 
This certificate was found to be the best in a resource constrained environment like sensor networks.
The ECC is implemented in MATLAB and the generated keys are used in DSA which is implemented in C++
